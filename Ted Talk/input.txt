0:13Well, we all need a reason to wake up.
0:18For me, it just took 11,000 volts.
0:23I know you're too polite to ask,
0:24so I will tell you.
0:27One night, sophomore year of college,
0:29just back from Thanksgiving holiday,
0:33a few of my friends and I were horsing around,
0:35and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train.
0:40It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead.
0:43Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time.
0:46We'd certainly done stupider things.
0:50I scurried up the ladder on the back,
0:53and when I stood up,
0:55the electrical current entered my arm,
0:58blew down and out my feet, and that was that.
1:03Would you believe that watch still works?
1:08Takes a licking!
1:09(Laughter)
1:10My father wears it now in solidarity.
1:15That night began my formal relationship with death -- my death --
1:21and it also began my long run as a patient.
1:25It's a good word.
1:26It means one who suffers.
1:28So I guess we're all patients.
1:31Now, the American health care system
1:33has more than its fair share of dysfunction --
1:37to match its brilliance, to be sure.
1:39I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc,
1:44so I've seen care from both sides.
1:47And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare
1:50really means well -- I mean, truly.
1:54But we who work in it are also unwitting agents
1:58for a system that too often does not serve.
2:03Why?
2:05Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question,
2:09and it explains a lot:
2:11because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center.
2:18Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed.
2:22And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking
2:28or the opportunity for good design more compelling
2:31than at the end of life,
2:33where things are so distilled and concentrated.
2:38There are no do-overs.
2:42My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines
2:46and invite design thinking into this big conversation.
2:51That is, to bring intention and creativity
2:56to the experience of dying.
3:01We have a monumental opportunity in front of us,
3:05before one of the few universal issues
3:09as individuals as well as a civil society:
3:12to rethink and redesign how it is we die.
3:19So let's begin at the end.
3:23For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead,
3:27it's dying, suffering.
3:29It's a key distinction.
3:32To get underneath this, it can be very helpful
3:34to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is,
3:39from suffering we can change.
3:42The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal,
3:47and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow.
3:55It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves.
4:01They bring proportionality,
4:04like a cosmic right-sizing.
4:08After my limbs were gone,
4:11that loss, for example, became fact, fixed --
4:15necessarily part of my life,
4:19and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself.
4:27It took me a while, but I learned it eventually.
4:30Now, another great thing about necessary suffering
4:33is that it is the very thing
4:36that unites caregiver and care receiver --
4:41human beings.
4:45This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens.
4:49Yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday --
4:53suffering together.
4:56Now, on the systems side, on the other hand,
5:00so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented.
5:04It serves no good purpose.
5:06But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up,
5:10well, we can change it.
5:13How we die is indeed something we can affect.
5:18Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction
5:22between necessary and unnecessary suffering
5:25gives us our first of three design cues for the day.
5:30After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care,
5:34is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile.
5:42True to the tenets of palliative care,
5:44I function as something of a reflective advocate,
5:47as much as prescribing physician.
5:51Quick aside: palliative care -- a very important field but poorly understood --
5:57while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care.
6:00It is not limited to hospice.
6:02It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage.
6:06So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon
6:10to benefit from palliative care.
6:13Now, let me introduce you to Frank.
6:17Sort of makes this point.
6:19I've been seeing Frank now for years.
6:21He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV.
6:26We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,
6:28but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life --
6:32really, about our lives.
6:35In this way, Frank grieves.
6:37In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in,
6:41so that he's ready to take in the next moment.
6:45Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another.
6:51Frank has always been an adventurer --
6:53he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting --
6:56and no fan of regret.
6:58So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day,
7:01saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River.
7:05Was this a good idea?
7:07With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no.
7:11Many did, but he went for it, while he still could.
7:15It was a glorious, marvelous trip:
7:20freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes,
7:26wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon --
7:31all the glorious side of the world beyond our control.
7:36Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,
7:38is exactly the kind so many of us would make,
7:40if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time.
7:49So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective.
7:54After my accident, when I went back to college,
7:56I changed my major to art history.
8:00Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see --
8:05a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change
8:09so much of what he was seeing.
8:12Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with,
8:16turning anguish into a flower.
8:21Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco
8:25called the Zen Hospice Project,
8:28where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective.
8:32When one of our residents dies,
8:35the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden,
8:39heading for the gate, we pause.
8:42Anyone who wants --
8:44fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers,
8:46the hearse drivers too, now --
8:49shares a story or a song or silence,
8:53as we sprinkle the body with flower petals.
8:57It takes a few minutes;
8:59it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth,
9:04rather than repugnance.
9:08Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting,
9:13much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines
9:18and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has.
9:23Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away,
9:26and it all feels as though that person had never really existed.
9:33Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility,
9:35but hospitals tend to assault our senses,
9:39and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness --
9:44anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic.
9:50I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them.
9:56But we ask too much of our hospitals.
9:59They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness.
10:03They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.
10:10Now mind you -- I am not giving up on the notion
10:12that our institutions can become more humane.
10:16Beauty can be found anywhere.
10:21I spent a few months in a burn unit
10:23at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey,
10:26where I got really great care at every turn,
10:30including good palliative care for my pain.
10:33And one night, it began to snow outside.
10:37I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it.
10:42And there was no window in my room,
10:44but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky.
10:49Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me.
10:53She brought it in to the unit.
10:56I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand,
11:02and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin;
11:05the miracle of it all,
11:07the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water.
11:15In that moment,
11:17just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me
11:21than whether I lived or died.
11:24That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed
11:27to both try to live and be OK if I did not.
11:31In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.
11:36In my work over the years, I've known many people
11:39who were ready to go, ready to die.
11:43Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence,
11:47but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become --
11:54in a word, cut off, or ugly.
12:03There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness,
12:09and into ever older age.
12:11And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami.
12:19We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle
12:22these seismic shifts in our population.
12:27Now is the time to create something new, something vital.
12:30I know we can because we have to.
12:33The alternative is just unacceptable.
12:35And the key ingredients are known:
12:37policy, education and training,
12:41systems, bricks and mortar.
12:44We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with.
12:49We know, for example, from research
12:51what's most important to people who are closer to death:
12:54comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love;
13:01existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality.
13:08Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,
13:12we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail.
13:17Little things aren't so little.
13:21Take Janette.
13:22She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS.
13:26Well, guess what?
13:28She wants to start smoking again --
13:31and French cigarettes, if you please.
13:36Not out of some self-destructive bent,
13:39but to feel her lungs filled while she has them.
13:44Priorities change.
13:47Or Kate -- she just wants to know
13:50her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed,
13:54his cold muzzle against her dry skin,
13:57instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins --
14:00she's done that.
14:02Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant,
14:07we are rewarded for just being.
14:15So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses,
14:19by way of the body -- the very thing doing the living and the dying.
14:26Probably the most poignant room
14:27in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen,
14:30which is a little strange when you realize
14:32that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all.
14:36But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels:
14:41smell, a symbolic plane.
14:46Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof,
14:51one of the most tried and true interventions we know of,
14:55is to bake cookies.
15:10As long as we have our senses --
15:11even just one --
15:13we have at least the possibility of accessing
15:17what makes us feel human, connected.
15:22Imagine the ripples of this notion
15:25for the millions of people living and dying with dementia.
15:29Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for,
15:33impulses that make us stay present --
15:36no need for a past or a future.
15:42So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue,
15:50then tending to dignity by way of the senses,
15:53by way of the body -- the aesthetic realm --
15:57is design cue number two.
15:59Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today;
16:03namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being,
16:10so that life and health and healthcare
16:13can become about making life more wonderful,
16:16rather than just less horrible.
16:20Beneficence.
16:22Here, this gets right at the distinction
16:25between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care,
16:30and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative,
16:33even playful act.
16:36"Play" may sound like a funny word here.
16:39But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation.
16:42Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human.
16:47The need for food has birthed cuisine.
16:49The need for shelter has given rise to architecture.
16:52The need for cover, fashion.
16:54And for being subjected to the clock,
16:57well, we invented music.
17:03So, since dying is a necessary part of life,
17:06what might we create with this fact?
17:12By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying
17:15or that we mandate any particular way of dying.
17:18There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move,
17:20and one way or another, we will all kneel there.
17:24Rather, I am asking that we make space --
17:28physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out --
17:34so that rather than just getting out of the way,
17:37aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end.
17:44We can't solve for death.
17:50I know some of you are working on this.
17:52(Laughter)
17:57Meanwhile, we can --
17:58(Laughter)
18:00We can design towards it.
18:04Parts of me died early on,
18:05and that's something we can all say one way or another.
18:08I got to redesign my life around this fact,
18:11and I tell you it has been a liberation
18:14to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning
18:17in what life you have left,
18:20like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment,
18:22all the while melting away.
18:26If we love such moments ferociously,
18:32then maybe we can learn to live well --
18:35not in spite of death,
18:37but because of it.
18:42Let death be what takes us,
18:44not lack of imagination.
18:48Thank you.
18:50(Applause)
