Well, we all need a reason to wake up
For me, it just took 11,000 volts
I know you're too polite to ask
so I will tell you
One night, sophomore year of college
just back from Thanksgiving holiday
a few of my friends and I were horsing around
and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train
It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead
Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time
We'd certainly done stupider things
I scurried up the ladder on the back
and when I stood up
the electrical current entered my arm
blew down and out my feet, and that was that
Would you believe that watch still works
Takes a licking
(Laughter
My father wears it now in solidarity
That night began my formal relationship with death -- my death -
and it also began my long run as a patient
It's a good word
It means one who suffers
So I guess we're all patients
Now, the American health care syste
has more than its fair share of dysfunction -
to match its brilliance, to be sure
I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc
so I've seen care from both sides
And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcar
really means well -- I mean, truly
But we who work in it are also unwitting agent
for a system that too often does not serve
Why
Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question
and it explains a lot
because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center
Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed
And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreakin
or the opportunity for good design more compellin
than at the end of life
where things are so distilled and concentrated
There are no do-overs
My purpose today is to reach out across discipline
and invite design thinking into this big conversation
That is, to bring intention and creativit
to the experience of dying
We have a monumental opportunity in front of us
before one of the few universal issue
as individuals as well as a civil society
to rethink and redesign how it is we die
So let's begin at the end
For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead
it's dying, suffering
It's a key distinction
To get underneath this, it can be very helpfu
to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is
from suffering we can change
The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal
and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow
It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves
They bring proportionality
like a cosmic right-sizing
After my limbs were gone
that loss, for example, became fact, fixed -
necessarily part of my life
and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself
It took me a while, but I learned it eventually
Now, another great thing about necessary sufferin
is that it is the very thin
that unites caregiver and care receiver -
human beings
This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens
Yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday -
suffering together
Now, on the systems side, on the other hand
so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented
It serves no good purpose
But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up
well, we can change it
How we die is indeed something we can affect
Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinctio
between necessary and unnecessary sufferin
gives us our first of three design cues for the day
After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care
is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile
True to the tenets of palliative care
I function as something of a reflective advocate
as much as prescribing physician
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very important field but poorly understood -
while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care
It is not limited to hospice
It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage
So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soo
to benefit from palliative care
Now, let me introduce you to Frank
Sort of makes this point
I've been seeing Frank now for years
He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue
but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life -
really, about our lives
In this way, Frank grieves
In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in
so that he's ready to take in the next moment
Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another
Frank has always been an adventurer -
he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting -
and no fan of regret
So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day
saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River
Was this a good idea
With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no
Many did, but he went for it, while he still could
It was a glorious, marvelous trip
freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes
wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon -
all the glorious side of the world beyond our control
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic
is exactly the kind so many of us would make
if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time
So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective
After my accident, when I went back to college
I changed my major to art history
Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see -
a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't chang
so much of what he was seeing
Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with
turning anguish into a flower
Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisc
called the Zen Hospice Project
where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective
When one of our residents dies
the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden
heading for the gate, we pause
Anyone who wants -
fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers
the hearse drivers too, now -
shares a story or a song or silence
as we sprinkle the body with flower petals
It takes a few minutes
it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth
rather than repugnance
Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting
much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machine
and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has
Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away
and it all feels as though that person had never really existed
Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility
but hospitals tend to assault our senses
and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness -
anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic
I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them
But we ask too much of our hospitals
They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness
They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for
Now mind you -- I am not giving up on the notio
that our institutions can become more humane
Beauty can be found anywhere
I spent a few months in a burn uni
at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey
where I got really great care at every turn
including good palliative care for my pain
And one night, it began to snow outside
I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it
And there was no window in my room
but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky
Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me
She brought it in to the unit
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand
and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin
the miracle of it all
the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water
In that moment
just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to m
than whether I lived or died
That little snowball packed all the inspiration I neede
to both try to live and be OK if I did not
In a hospital, that's a stolen moment
In my work over the years, I've known many peopl
who were ready to go, ready to die
Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence
but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become -
in a word, cut off, or ugly
There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness
and into ever older age
And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami
We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handl
these seismic shifts in our population
Now is the time to create something new, something vital
I know we can because we have to
The alternative is just unacceptable
And the key ingredients are known
policy, education and training
systems, bricks and mortar
We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with
We know, for example, from researc
what's most important to people who are closer to death
comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love
existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality
Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years
we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail
Little things aren't so little
Take Janette
She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS
Well, guess what
She wants to start smoking again -
and French cigarettes, if you please
Not out of some self-destructive bent
but to feel her lungs filled while she has them
Priorities change
Or Kate -- she just wants to kno
her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed
his cold muzzle against her dry skin
instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins -
she's done that
Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant
we are rewarded for just being
So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses
by way of the body -- the very thing doing the living and the dying
Probably the most poignant roo
in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen
which is a little strange when you realiz
that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all
But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels
smell, a symbolic plane
Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof
one of the most tried and true interventions we know of
is to bake cookies
As long as we have our senses -
even just one -
we have at least the possibility of accessin
what makes us feel human, connected
Imagine the ripples of this notio
for the millions of people living and dying with dementia
Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for
impulses that make us stay present -
no need for a past or a future
So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue
then tending to dignity by way of the senses
by way of the body -- the aesthetic realm -
is design cue number two
Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today
namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being
so that life and health and healthcar
can become about making life more wonderful
rather than just less horrible
Beneficence
Here, this gets right at the distinctio
between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care
and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative
even playful act
"Play" may sound like a funny word here
But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation
Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human
The need for food has birthed cuisine
The need for shelter has given rise to architecture
The need for cover, fashion
And for being subjected to the clock
well, we invented music
So, since dying is a necessary part of life
what might we create with this fact
By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dyin
or that we mandate any particular way of dying
There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move
and one way or another, we will all kneel there
Rather, I am asking that we make space -
physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out -
so that rather than just getting out of the way
aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end
We can't solve for death
I know some of you are working on this
(Laughter
Meanwhile, we can -
(Laughter
We can design towards it
Parts of me died early on
and that's something we can all say one way or another
I got to redesign my life around this fact
and I tell you it has been a liberatio
to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meanin
in what life you have left
like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment
all the while melting away
If we love such moments ferociously
then maybe we can learn to live well -
not in spite of death
but because of it
Let death be what takes us
not lack of imagination
Thank you

4but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky
9Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me
3She brought it in to the unit
6I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand
2and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin
5the miracle of it all
7the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water
5In that moment
7just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to m
1than whether I lived or died
4That little snowball packed all the inspiration I neede
7to both try to live and be OK if I did not
1In a hospital, that's a stolen moment
6In my work over the years, I've known many peopl
9who were ready to go, ready to die
3Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence
7but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become -
4in a word, cut off, or ugly
3There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness
9and into ever older age
1And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami
9We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handl
2these seismic shifts in our population
7Now is the time to create something new, something vital
0I know we can because we have to
3The alternative is just unacceptable
5And the key ingredients are known
7policy, education and training
1systems, bricks and mortar
4We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with
9We know, for example, from researc
1what's most important to people who are closer to death
4comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love
1existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality
8Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years
2we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail
7Little things aren't so little
1Take Janette
2She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS
6Well, guess what
8She wants to start smoking again -
1and French cigarettes, if you please
6Not out of some self-destructive bent
9but to feel her lungs filled while she has them
4Priorities change
7Or Kate -- she just wants to kno
0her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed
4his cold muzzle against her dry skin
7instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins -
0she's done that
2Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant
7we are rewarded for just being
5So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses
9by way of the body -- the very thing doing the living and the dying
6Probably the most poignant roo
7in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen
0which is a little strange when you realiz
2that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all
6But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels
1smell, a symbolic plane
6Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof
1one of the most tried and true interventions we know of
5is to bake cookies
0As long as we have our senses -
1even just one -
3we have at least the possibility of accessin
7what makes us feel human, connected
2Imagine the ripples of this notio
5for the millions of people living and dying with dementia
9Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for
3impulses that make us stay present -
6no need for a past or a future
2So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue
0then tending to dignity by way of the senses
3by way of the body -- the aesthetic realm -
7is design cue number two
9Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today
3namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being
0so that life and health and healthcar
3can become about making life more wonderful
6rather than just less horrible
0Beneficence
2Here, this gets right at the distinctio
5between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care
0and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative
3even playful act
6"Play" may sound like a funny word here
9But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation
2Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human
7The need for food has birthed cuisine
9The need for shelter has given rise to architecture
2The need for cover, fashion
4And for being subjected to the clock
7well, we invented music
3So, since dying is a necessary part of life
6what might we create with this fact
2By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dyin
5or that we mandate any particular way of dying
8There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move
0and one way or another, we will all kneel there
4Rather, I am asking that we make space -
8physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out -
4so that rather than just getting out of the way
7aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end
4We can't solve for death
0I know some of you are working on this
2(Laughter
7Meanwhile, we can -
8(Laughter
0We can design towards it
4Parts of me died early on
5and that's something we can all say one way or another
8I got to redesign my life around this fact
1and I tell you it has been a liberatio
4to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meanin
7in what life you have left
0like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment
2all the while melting away
6If we love such moments ferociously
2then maybe we can learn to live well -
5not in spite of death
7but because of it
2Let death be what takes us
4not lack of imagination
8Thank you
0(Applause
Well, we all need a reason to wake up
For me, it just took 11,000 volts
I know you're too polite to ask
so I will tell you
One night, sophomore year of college
just back from Thanksgiving holiday
a few of my friends and I were horsing around
and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train
It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead
Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time
We'd certainly done stupider things
I scurried up the ladder on the back
and when I stood up
the electrical current entered my arm
blew down and out my feet, and that was that
Would you believe that watch still works
Takes a licking
(Laughter
My father wears it now in solidarity
That night began my formal relationship with death -- my death -
and it also began my long run as a patient
It's a good word
It means one who suffers
So I guess we're all patients
Now, the American health care syste
has more than its fair share of dysfunction -
to match its brilliance, to be sure
I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc
so I've seen care from both sides
And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcar
really means well -- I mean, truly
But we who work in it are also unwitting agent
for a system that too often does not serve
Why
Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question
and it explains a lot
because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center
Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed
And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreakin
or the opportunity for good design more compellin
than at the end of life
where things are so distilled and concentrated
There are no do-overs
My purpose today is to reach out across discipline
and invite design thinking into this big conversation
That is, to bring intention and creativit
to the experience of dying
We have a monumental opportunity in front of us
before one of the few universal issue
as individuals as well as a civil society
to rethink and redesign how it is we die
So let's begin at the end
For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead
it's dying, suffering
It's a key distinction
To get underneath this, it can be very helpfu
to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is
from suffering we can change
The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal
and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow
It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves
They bring proportionality
like a cosmic right-sizing
After my limbs were gone
that loss, for example, became fact, fixed -
necessarily part of my life
and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself
It took me a while, but I learned it eventually
Now, another great thing about necessary sufferin
is that it is the very thin
that unites caregiver and care receiver -
human beings
This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens
Yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday -
suffering together
Now, on the systems side, on the other hand
so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented
It serves no good purpose
But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up
well, we can change it
How we die is indeed something we can affect
Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinctio
between necessary and unnecessary sufferin
gives us our first of three design cues for the day
After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care
is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile
True to the tenets of palliative care
I function as something of a reflective advocate
as much as prescribing physician
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very important field but poorly understood -
while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care
It is not limited to hospice
It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage
So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soo
to benefit from palliative care
Now, let me introduce you to Frank
Sort of makes this point
I've been seeing Frank now for years
He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue
but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life -
really, about our lives
In this way, Frank grieves
In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in
so that he's ready to take in the next moment
Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another
Frank has always been an adventurer -
he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting -
and no fan of regret
So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day
saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River
Was this a good idea
With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no
Many did, but he went for it, while he still could
It was a glorious, marvelous trip
freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes
wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon -
all the glorious side of the world beyond our control
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic
is exactly the kind so many of us would make
if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time
So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective
After my accident, when I went back to college
I changed my major to art history
Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see -
a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't chang
so much of what he was seeing
Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with
turning anguish into a flower
Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisc
called the Zen Hospice Project
where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective
When one of our residents dies
the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden
heading for the gate, we pause
Anyone who wants -
fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers
the hearse drivers too, now -
shares a story or a song or silence
as we sprinkle the body with flower petals
It takes a few minutes
it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth
rather than repugnance
Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting
much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machine
and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has
Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away
and it all feels as though that person had never really existed
Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility
but hospitals tend to assault our senses
and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness -
anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic
I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them
But we ask too much of our hospitals
They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness
3They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for
0Now mind you -- I am not giving up on the notio
2that our institutions can become more humane
6Beauty can be found anywhere
1I spent a few months in a burn uni
3at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey
6where I got really great care at every turn
0including good palliative care for my pain
3And one night, it began to snow outside
7I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it
2And there was no window in my room
4but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky
9Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me

2The need for cover, fashion
4And for being subjected to the clock
7well, we invented music
3So, since dying is a necessary part of life
6what might we create with this fact
2By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dyin
5or that we mandate any particular way of dying
8There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move
0and one way or another, we will all kneel there
4Rather, I am asking that we make space -
8physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out -
4so that rather than just getting out of the way
7aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end
4We can't solve for death
0I know some of you are working on this
2(Laughter
7Meanwhile, we can -
8(Laughter
0We can design towards it
4Parts of me died early on
5and that's something we can all say one way or another
8I got to redesign my life around this fact
1and I tell you it has been a liberatio
4to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meanin
7in what life you have left
0like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment
2all the while melting away
6If we love such moments ferociously
2then maybe we can learn to live well -
5not in spite of death
7but because of it
2Let death be what takes us
4not lack of imagination
8Thank you
